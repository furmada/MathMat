  abstract     = {We present an iterative method for solving linear systems, which has the property of minimizing at every step the norm of the residual vector over a Krylov subspace. The algorithm is derived from the Arnoldi process for constructing an \$l\_2 \$-orthogonal basis of Krylov subspaces. It can be considered as a generalization of Paige and Saundersâ€™ MINRES algorithm and is theoretically equivalent to the Generalized Conjugate Residual (GCR) method and to ORTHODIR. The new algorithm presents several advantages over GCR and ORTHODIR.},
