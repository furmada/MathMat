The algorithm is derived from the Arnoldi process for constructing an \$l\_2 \$-orthogonal basis of Krylov subspaces. It can be considered as a generalization of Paige and Saundersâ€™ MINRES algorithm and is theoretically equivalent to the Generalized Conjugate Residual (GCR) method and to ORTHODIR. The new algorithm presents several advantages over GCR and ORTHODIR.},

GMRES is one of the best Krylov solvers with several different variants to solve large sparse linear systems. Any GMRES implementation has some advantages. As the solution of ill-posed problems are important. In this paper, some GMRES variants are discussed and applied to solve these kinds of problems. Residual smoothing techniques are efficient ways to accelerate the convergence speed of some iterative methods like CG variants. At the end of this paper, some residual smoothing techniques are applied for different GMRES methods to test the influence of these techniques on GMRES implementations.},
